This repository contains a YouTube Clone project, built using only HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the layout and styling of the YouTube homepage, focusing on recreating a familiar user interface with responsive design principles. While it doesn't include functionality like video playback or search, it provides a visually accurate structure of the platform.
